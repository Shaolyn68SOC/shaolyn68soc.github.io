## 🚚 From Trucking to Threat Hunting: My SOC Analyst Journey

Hi there 👋 I'm ShaoLyn68SOC — a former truck driver whose life took a sharp turn due to a serious illness. That challenge became a catalyst for transformation, and today I'm training to become a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst. I’ve traded highways for networks, and now I’m focused on defending digital infrastructure from cyber threats.

## 💬 Why Cybersecurity?

After facing a life-threatening illness, I wanted to find a new mission — one that protects others and gives me purpose. Cybersecurity is that mission. It’s a field where vigilance, grit, and curiosity matter — and I bring all three from my past life on the road.
